# Cheatsheets
-----

Resources to be used as quick references when your brain is busy doing more important work. The idea for this repo was created @yvga for the purpose of keeping important info/commands in one easy to navigate place. It's impossible to remember everything we put into our heads, but it's still up there somewhere and these cheatsheets will help us when we just can't seem to "remember that command, the one that could save the day but I can't remember what it's called."

 Everyone is encouraged to use these resources as at meetups and at home. Right now the collection is small so any suggestions and contributions are welcome. Feel free to make a pull request with additional resources or request to join this repo and help add more cheatsheets.

A couple cheatsheets that might be useful
* SQL Cheatsheet

* any other ideas?
